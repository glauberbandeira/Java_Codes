# 🧮 Basic Arithmetic Operations in Java

This Java program, `Calculate`, is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition ➕, subtraction ➖, multiplication ✖️, and division ➗ based on the user's input. It takes command-line arguments to determine the operation and the operands.

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run

Ensure you have Java ☕ installed on your system. You can verify this by running `java -version` in your terminal or command prompt. If Java is installed, you should see the version information.

### 🛠 Compilation

To compile the `Calculate` program, navigate to the directory containing `Calculate.java` and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
javac Calculate.java

🏃 Running the Program
After compiling, you can run the program with the java command followed by the class name Calculate and three arguments: the operation (somar, subtrair, multiplicar, dividir) and the two numbers to operate on. Here are some examples:

java Calculate somar 5 3
java Calculate subtrair 10 4
java Calculate multiplicar 7 6
java Calculate dividir 8 2

📚 Operations
somar (Add) ➕: Adds two numbers.
subtrair (Subtract) ➖: Subtracts the second number from the first.
multiplicar (Multiply) ✖️: Multiplies two numbers.
dividir (Divide) ➗: Divides the first number by the second. Note: The program will print an error message if you attempt to divide by zero.

✨ Features
