# Mega Sena Number Generator

This simple Java program is a number generator for Mega Sena, one of Brazil's most popular lotteries. It utilizes Java's `Random` class to generate six random integers between 0 and 59, simulating the process of picking numbers for a Mega Sena ticket.

## How to Run

To run this program, you must have Java installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`, followed by the URL of this repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the folder where `MegaSena.java` is saved.
3. Compile the program using the command `javac MegaSena.java`.
4. Execute the compiled program with `java MegaSena`.

Each execution of the program will generate six new random numbers that you can use to play Mega Sena.

## About the Code

The program uses the `Random` class to generate random numbers. Number generation takes place within a `for` loop, which repeats six times to generate six numbers. The numbers are generated in the range of 0 to 59. This range can be adjusted as needed, but it is set to match the rules of the Mega Sena lottery.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to understand more about how Java's random number generation works or to adapt the program for other purposes.
